#1-Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate π (pi) up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

#2-Find e to the Nth Digit - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of π (pi). Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal
#places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

#3-Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

#4-Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

#5- Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

#6-Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.

#7- Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

#8-Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.

#9-Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.


#10-Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).

#11-Tax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.

#12-Happy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.

#13-Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.
